class VolumeMicrogel(Suspension,WeakParticle):
    """
    Represents a microgel suspension of volume-charged microgels.

    This class is a child of the `Suspension` and `WeakParticle` classes, designed to model 
    microgel suspensions with either strong or weakly charged particles. It includes methods 
    for setting up the system, solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, and calculating 
    reservoir concentrations.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    a : float
        Particle radius in nanometers [nm].
    Z_a : float
        Maximum charge of acid sites in units of the fundamental charge `e`.
    Z_b : float
        Maximum charge of basic sites in units of the fundamental charge `e`.
    lb : float
        Bjerrum length in nanometers [nm].
    vol_frac : float
        Suspension volume fraction.
    c_salt : float
        Reservoir salt concentration in molars [M].
    charge_type : str
        Type of particle charge, either 'strong' or 'weak'.
    pK_a : float, optional
        pK of the acid sites, required if `charge_type='weak'`. Default is 4.
    pK_b : float, optional
        pK of the basic sites, required if `charge_type='weak'`. Default is 4.
    pH_res : float, optional
        Reservoir pH, required if `charge_type='weak'`. Default is 7.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    vol_frac : float
        Suspension volume fraction.
    R_cell : float
        Cell radius, calculated based on the particle radius and volume fraction.
    c_tilde : float
        Reservoir concentration in number of particles per nmÂ³.
    kresa : float
        Screening constant for the system.

    Methods:
    --------
    set_grid(r: np.array):
        Sets the radial grid for solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation.
    reservoir_concent(c_Hres, c_salt):
        Determines the reservoir salt concentration for charge-regulated systems, 
        accounting for water autodissociation.
    solve_nonlin_PB(r, y_init):
        Solves the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the system.

    Description:
    ------------
    The `VolumeMicrogel` class models microgel suspensions with either strong or weak charges. 
    For strong charges, the reservoir concentration is directly calculated. For weak charges, 
    the class uses the `WeakParticle` parent class to account for charge regulation based on 
    pH and pK values. The class also provides methods to set up the radial grid, compute 
    reservoir concentrations, and solve the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the system.

        Description:
        ------------
        This method solves the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the system. 
        The radial grid is normalized by the particle radius (`a`) before solving. 
        Depending on the `charge_type` of the system (`strong` or `weak`), the method 
        uses different parameter sets and equations:

        - For `strong` charges, the parameters include the screening constant (`kresa`) 
        and the linear charge density (`Zlba`). The equations and boundary conditions 
        are defined in the `PBstrong` module.
        - For `weak` charges, additional parameters such as the dissociation constants 
        (`Ka`, `Kb`) and coupling parameters (`xi_a`, `xi_b`) are used. The equations 
        and boundary conditions are defined in the `PBweak` module.

        The solution is obtained using the `solve_bvp` method from `scipy.integrate`. 
        The electric potential and electric field are extracted from the solution and 
        stored in the `elec_pot` and `elec_field` attributes, respectively. The radial 
        grid is converted back to its original units and stored in the `r` attribute.
